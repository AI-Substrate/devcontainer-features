# Sonnet Review: Flowspace DevContainer Feature

## Analysis Summary

After reviewing the flowspace-feature.md document and current implementation, I've identified the core issue was much simpler than initially thought:

**Root Cause**: The Flowspace installer requires Docker to be running during installation, but in devcontainers, Docker-in-Docker only starts the Docker daemon after all features are installed. The feature dependencies are working correctly - the issue is timing.

**Simple Solution**: Defer Flowspace installation to post-container-startup using `postCreateCommand`.

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Docker Timing Issue (Primary)
**Problem**: Flowspace installer requires Docker to be running, but Docker-in-Docker only starts the daemon after feature installation completes.

**Solution**: Use `postCreateCommand` to install Flowspace after the container is fully started and Docker is available.

### 2. Feature Dependencies Working Correctly
**Status**: The `installsAfter` configuration is working properly. Both `common-utils` and `docker-in-docker` install before the flowspace feature.

**Verification**: Tools like `curl`, `jq`, and `tar` are available during flowspace feature execution.

## Simple Solution

### Simplified Feature Architecture
Instead of trying to install Flowspace during the build phase, set up the environment and defer installation:

1. **Feature Installation Phase** (install.sh):
   - Verify prerequisites (curl, jq, tar from common-utils)
   - Set up environment variables for Flowspace
   - Provide installation instructions for post-startup

2. **Container Startup Phase** (postCreateCommand):
   - Run the Flowspace installer when Docker is available
   - Complete the installation process

### Updated devcontainer.json Template
```jsonc
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/AI-Substrate/devcontainer-features/flowspace:0": {}
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `postCreateCommand` is now built into the feature definition, so users don't need to add it manually.

### Simplified install.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

FEATURE_NAME="flowspace"

log() {
    echo "[flowspace] $*"
}

VERSION="${VERSION:-latest}"
PRERELEASE="${PRERELEASE:-false}"

# Check prerequisites are available
for tool in curl tar jq; do
    if ! command -v "$tool" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "[flowspace] ❌ Missing required tool: $tool"
        exit 1
    fi
done

log "Prerequisites check passed"

# Set up environment variables for flowspace installer
{
    echo "# Flowspace environment variables"
    if [ "${PRERELEASE}" = "true" ]; then
        echo "export FLOWSPACE_PRE_RELEASE=1"
    fi
    if [ -n "${VERSION}" ] && [ "${VERSION}" != "latest" ]; then
        echo "export FLOWSPACE_VERSION=\"${VERSION}\""
    fi
} >> /root/.bashrc

log "Environment setup complete. Flowspace will be installed on container startup."
```

## Simplified Architecture

The over-complicated documentation can be reduced to these essentials:

### Required Features (2 total)
1. **common-utils**: Provides `curl`, `jq`, `tar` needed by flowspace installer
2. **docker-in-docker**: Provides Docker daemon that flowspace requires

### Feature Order
The `installsAfter` declaration ensures common-utils runs first, providing the tools needed for the flowspace installation.

### Basic devcontainer.json Template
```jsonc
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/AI-Substrate/devcontainer-features/flowspace:0": {}
  }
}
```

## Test Improvements

### Enhanced Test Script
The current test only checks `flowspace --version`. A more comprehensive test:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "Testing Flowspace installation..."

# Test 1: Binary availability
if ! command -v flowspace >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "❌ flowspace command not found"
    exit 1
fi

# Test 2: Version output
VERSION_OUTPUT=$(flowspace --version 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$VERSION_OUTPUT" ]; then
    echo "❌ flowspace --version failed"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Flowspace version: $VERSION_OUTPUT"

# Test 3: Docker availability
if ! command -v docker >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "⚠️  Docker not available - flowspace scans will fail"
else
    echo "✅ Docker CLI available"
fi

# Test 4: Help output works
if flowspace --help >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "✅ Flowspace help accessible"
else
    echo "❌ flowspace --help failed"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All tests passed"
```

## Final Solution

The best approach turned out to be **extracting the core installation logic from the official installer** and running it during the build phase, avoiding the Docker validation entirely.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Extracted download logic**: Copied version detection, download, and extraction logic from https://aka.ms/InstallFlowspace
2. **Removed Docker validation**: The official installer checks for Docker availability, but we skip that during build
3. **System-wide installation**: Install to `/usr/local/bin` instead of user-specific directory so it's available to all users
4. **Build-time installation**: Install during feature build when `common-utils` tools are available

## Test Results

✅ **Build Phase**: Flowspace downloads and installs to `/usr/local/bin/flowspace`  
✅ **Runtime Phase**: Binary is available to all users, Docker works for scans  
✅ **Functionality**: All tests pass - flowspace --version, --help, and Docker CLI work correctly

## Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Docker availability timing - installer validates Docker during build, but Docker-in-Docker only starts later.

**Solution**: Extract installation logic, skip Docker validation, install to system directory during build.

**Key Insight**: Sometimes you need to adapt upstream installers for containerized environments rather than deferring the entire process.
